# Privacy

1. A lot of times you need a phone number for verification. One service that people use for this in a more privacy focused manner is Hushed \
**Hushed** https://hushed.com/ \
2. Most time you do OSINT, you want to be using a VPN. It would be wise to find one where you can use cash, a privacy focused card, or even a gift card. An example of one that accepts gift cards for payment is Private Internet Access \

3. Be aware that even if you choose to use a VPN at home, and even if you have a killswitch for the VPN, the computer will likely still do an initial beacon to your router on boot up. \
