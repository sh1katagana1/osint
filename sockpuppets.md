# Sock Puppets

## What Are Sock Puppets?
Sock Puppets are burner accounts used in investigations and OSINT, with the intent of allowing some anonminity during the investigation. The attention to detail on creating these would depend on what they will be used for. For example, usage of these in social media investigations may warrant extra steps such as getting a burner phone as well as establishing a good deal of history with the account to further its legitimacy. While Dark Web investigations may not need that sort of time input. 

## Best Practices When Creating Sock Accounts
1. For social media accounts, take some time to develop a full back story and try to keep it as opposite to your real life as possible
2. Keep notes on your details, as well as the credentials. A good suggestion is a password manager where you can store the credentials as well as lengthy notes on the account.
3. It is not recommended to use a VPN when creating the account (usage of the created account is a different story) as some VPN IPs may be blocked, usually with social media site account creation
4. It is recommended to use a cellular/mobile hotspot connection for creation of accounts due to its inherent dynamic/shared IP space being fairly large
5. It is recommended to get a free tier cloud site, like AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean VM and use these to create the accounts as these will have the cloud IPs associated with them.
6. It is recommended to roll your own VPN and use that to create accounts
7. For email addresses, do not use popular free ones like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. Some exceptions include gmx.us and protonmail. A recommended one is fastmail as it has a free tier for limited time, and does not require a backup email in order to sign up.
8. It is recommended you use a private domain for your email. Just grab a cheap godaddy or namecheap domain and webmail and make a bunch of accounts with them. One caveat is some sites may look for age of domain, so a new domain may get flagged.
9. If you get lucky and do not get a phone number requirement, be aware they may throw that requirement at you a few days later as a security check
10. Do not use VOIP as most flag this now.
11. It is recommended to get an unlocked android phone without carrier restriction so that you can use your own sim like Mint Mobile to act as your burner https://www.target.com/p/mint-mobile-7-day-trial-kit/-/A-54444205?ref=tgt_adv_xsf&AFID=google&CPNG=Electronics&adgroup=80-2
12. Once the account is created continually nurture it with content, as inactive accounts may get deleted.
13. When choosing a name, see how many there are with that name using a site like https://forebears.io/
14. For a profile/cover photo, there are some AI alternatives these days, but old techniques still workx, like https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en
15. Never assume the identity of a real person as that is identity theft.
16. It is recommended to use a stock phot from sites like https://pikwizard.com/ and https://pixabay.com/
17. It is recommended to create an avatar, like what you find at https://startupstash.com/metaverse-avatar-creation-tools
18. It is recommended to use a profile photo that is almost greyscale or a lot of shadow so as to not clearly see the face.
19. For social media socks, join multiple groups to appear active in communities. Nerdy groups do well especially if you are using an avatar. Do some liking and commenting on posts in these groups over several days.
20. It is recommended to use Facebooks Friend Finder, as Facebook will tell you who it already cross correlated with your profile. This reduces the chances of it getting flagged. https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/browser
21. Avoid political chat and comments as the 3 letter agencies tend to monitor these heavily.
