## DNSTWIST
https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist \
**Description** \
See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name. Find lookalike domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect typosquatters, phishing attacks, fraud, and brand impersonation. Useful as an additional source of targeted threat intelligence. \
**Install**
```
pip install dnstwist[full]
```
**Usage**
```
dnstwist --registered domain.name
```
This will checked every possible domains similar to your domain. it will display all unregistered and registered domains. 
```
dnstwist domain
```
Display only the ones that are registered
```
dnstwist -r domain
```
Display only unregistered ones
```
dnstwist -u domain
```
This option -b will display the HTTP and SMTP service banners on which these services are running. 
```
dnstwist -r -b domain
```
If domain permutations generated by the fuzzing algorithms are insufficient, please supply dnstwist with a dictionary file. Some dictionary samples with a list of the most common words used in phishing campaigns are included. These lists are english.dict, french.dict, polish.dict and we can update these lists also. These lists are located in '/etc/dnstwist/dictionaries'.
```
dnstwist -r -d disctionaries/'dictionary file name' domain
```
This option allows exporting results to CSV and JSON format (only these two formats are supported).
```
dnstwist -r -f csv domain name > name-of-file.csv
```
This option will display the registrar and created date of domains from WHOIS database.
```
dnstwist -r -w domain
```
Another dnstwist feature allows to perform a simple test on each mail server (advertised through DNS MX record) in order to check which one can be used for such hostile intent. Suspicious servers will be marked with SPYING-MX string. MX result alsways display as default with every option.
```
dnstwist -r -m domain
```
This option display geographical location (approximated to the country,real-time lookup) of IPv4 addresses.
```
dnstwist -r -g domain
```
This option used fuzzy hashes to compare two inputs (HTML code) and determine a fundamental level of similarity. The unique feature of detecting similar HTML source code can be enabled with ssdeep argument. For each generated domain, will fetch content from responding HTTP server (following possible redirects), normalize HTML code and compare its fuzzy hash with the one for the original (initial) domain. If the percentage is high, then it indicates that the sites at the inputted domain and the generated domain are almost the same and possibly being used in a phishing attack.
```
dnstwist -r --lsh ssdeep domain
```
By default, ssdeep is used as LSH algorithm, but TLSH is also available and can be enabled like so:
```
dnstwist --lsh tlsh domain.name
```
This option display all the registered domains with different tld such as .edu, .eu, .org, .fr etc.
```
dnstwist -r — tld dictionaries/common_tld.dict domain
```
This option display the messages of dnstwist tool while its process. The messages shows DNS query time out, failed and success.
```
dnstwist -r — debug domain
```
This options specifies a number of concurrent execution flows making the tool faster. By default it’s calculated based on the available CPU cores
```
dnstwist -r domain -t 'number of threads'
```
Specified User-Agents to send with HTTP requests. by default tool user agent is 'Mozilla/5.0 (linux 64-bit) dnstwist/20220815)'. You can see user agent by capturing the packets.
```
dnstwist — useragent 'user agent' -s 'URL'
```
This option shows the domains having name server IPs specified by you.
```
dnstwist domain — nameserver 'name server IPs'
```
This option shows all DNS records releted to target domain.
```
dnstwist -a domain
```
This option save the output in a file.
```
dnstwist domain -o 'file name with path'
```

## Subfinder
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder
Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that returns valid subdomains for websites, using passive online sources. It has a simple, modular architecture and is optimized for speed. subfinder is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.
```
Usage:
  ./subfinder [flags]

  -d, -domain string[]  domains to find subdomains for
  -dL, -list string     file containing list of domains for subdomain discovery

  -recursive                      use only sources that can handle subdomains recursively (e.g. subdomain.domain.tld vs domain.tld)
  -all                            use all sources for enumeration (slow)
  -es, -exclude-sources string[]  sources to exclude from enumeration (-es alienvault,zoomeyeapi)

  -rls value            maximum number of http requests to send per second four providers in key=value format (-rls "hackertarget=10/s,shodan=15/s")
  -t int                number of concurrent goroutines for resolving (-active only) (default 10)

UPDATE:
   -up, -update                 update subfinder to latest version
   -duc, -disable-update-check  disable automatic subfinder update check

OUTPUT:
  -o, -output string       file to write output to
  -oJ, -json               write output in JSONL(ines) format
  -oD, -output-dir string  directory to write output (-dL only)
  -cs, -collect-sources    include all sources in the output (-json only)
  -oI, -ip                 include host IP in output (-active only)

CONFIGURATION:
  -config string                flag config file (default "$HOME/.config/subfinder/config.yaml")
  -pc, -provider-config string  provider config file (default "$HOME/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml")
  -r string[]                   comma separated list of resolvers to use
  -rL, -rlist string            file containing list of resolvers to use

```
Install
```
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
```
Its best to install API keys with it. You can get to the config file here:
```
$HOME/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml
```
Usage
```
subfinder -d leroyjenkins.com
```
## BBOT
https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot \
BBOT (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a modular, recursive OSINT framework that can execute the entire OSINT workflow in a single command. BBOT is inspired by Spiderfoot but takes it to the next level with features like multi-target scans, lightning-fast asyncio performance, and NLP-powered subdomain mutations. It offers a wide range of functionality, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, web screenshots, vulnerability scanning, and much more. \

It appears that you have to run it from its venv location, which by default in Kali is .local/share/pipx/venvs/bbot/bin. Then from there do ./bbot

Installation
```
pipx install bbot
```
Perform a full subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com, along with cloud enumeration
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum cloud-enum
```
Perform a passive-only subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -rf passive
```
A basic web scan includes wappalyzer, robots.txt, and other non-intrusive web modules
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum web-basic
```
Port-scan every subdomain, screenshot every webpage, output to current directory
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -m nmap gowitness -n my_scan -o .
```
Crawl www.evilcorp.com up to a max depth of 2, automatically extracting emails, secrets, etc.
```
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -m httpx robots badsecrets secretsdb -c web_spider_distance=2 web_spider_depth=2
```
Subdomains, emails, cloud buckets, port scan, basic web, web screenshots, nuclei
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum email-enum cloud-enum web-basic -m nmap gowitness nuclei --allow-deadly
```
You can clean up the output to just found subdomains per line like so:
```
cat /root/.bbot/scans/{scan_name}/output.txt | grep -F '[DNS_NAME]’ | awk '{print $2}'
```
API keys: I did note that when I modified the secrets.yaml file with my API keys, it did not seem to want to load them. However, there is a way to do it in your command itself. You would do your normal commaand but then do -c then the name of the module, then the API key. To get the names of the modules, go here: https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/modules/list_of_modules/  A command example would be:
```
./bbot -t leroyjenkins.com -f subdomain-enum email-enum cloud-enum -c modules.shodan_dns.api_key=<api key> modules.builtwith.api_key=<api key> modules.binaryedge.api_key=<api key>
```

## BGP ASN Search
Its a good idea to search ASNs of the target company to see if they are in any other IP ranges. Go to https://bgp.he.net/ and type in the name of a company name (not the .com added to it) and search. It will give you a list of ASNs and Routes for anything matching that name. Looking under ASN, you may find additonal domains under the Prefix IPV4 tab
