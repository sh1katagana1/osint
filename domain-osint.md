## Subfinder
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder
Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that returns valid subdomains for websites, using passive online sources. It has a simple, modular architecture and is optimized for speed. subfinder is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.
```
Usage:
  ./subfinder [flags]

Flags:
INPUT:
  -d, -domain string[]  domains to find subdomains for
  -dL, -list string     file containing list of domains for subdomain discovery

SOURCE:
  -s, -sources string[]           specific sources to use for discovery (-s crtsh,github). Use -ls to display all available sources.
  -recursive                      use only sources that can handle subdomains recursively (e.g. subdomain.domain.tld vs domain.tld)
  -all                            use all sources for enumeration (slow)
  -es, -exclude-sources string[]  sources to exclude from enumeration (-es alienvault,zoomeyeapi)

FILTER:
  -m, -match string[]   subdomain or list of subdomain to match (file or comma separated)
  -f, -filter string[]   subdomain or list of subdomain to filter (file or comma separated)

RATE-LIMIT:
  -rl, -rate-limit int  maximum number of http requests to send per second
  -rls value            maximum number of http requests to send per second four providers in key=value format (-rls "hackertarget=10/s,shodan=15/s")
  -t int                number of concurrent goroutines for resolving (-active only) (default 10)

UPDATE:
   -up, -update                 update subfinder to latest version
   -duc, -disable-update-check  disable automatic subfinder update check

OUTPUT:
  -o, -output string       file to write output to
  -oJ, -json               write output in JSONL(ines) format
  -oD, -output-dir string  directory to write output (-dL only)
  -cs, -collect-sources    include all sources in the output (-json only)
  -oI, -ip                 include host IP in output (-active only)

CONFIGURATION:
  -config string                flag config file (default "$HOME/.config/subfinder/config.yaml")
  -pc, -provider-config string  provider config file (default "$HOME/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml")
  -r string[]                   comma separated list of resolvers to use
  -rL, -rlist string            file containing list of resolvers to use
  -nW, -active                  display active subdomains only
  -proxy string                 http proxy to use with subfinder
  -ei, -exclude-ip              exclude IPs from the list of domains

DEBUG:
  -silent             show only subdomains in output
  -version            show version of subfinder
  -v                  show verbose output
  -nc, -no-color      disable color in output
  -ls, -list-sources  list all available sources

OPTIMIZATION:
  -timeout int   seconds to wait before timing out (default 30)
  -max-time int  minutes to wait for enumeration results (default 10)
```
Install
```
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
```
Its best to install API keys with it. You can get to the config file here:
```
$HOME/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml
```
Usage
```
subfinder -d leroyjenkins.com
```
## BBOT
https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot \
BBOT (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a modular, recursive OSINT framework that can execute the entire OSINT workflow in a single command. BBOT is inspired by Spiderfoot but takes it to the next level with features like multi-target scans, lightning-fast asyncio performance, and NLP-powered subdomain mutations. It offers a wide range of functionality, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, web screenshots, vulnerability scanning, and much more. \
Installation
```
pipx install bbot
```
Perform a full subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum
```
Perform a passive-only subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -rf passive
```
A basic web scan includes wappalyzer, robots.txt, and other non-intrusive web modules
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum web-basic
```
Port-scan every subdomain, screenshot every webpage, output to current directory
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -m nmap gowitness -n my_scan -o .
```
Crawl www.evilcorp.com up to a max depth of 2, automatically extracting emails, secrets, etc.
```
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -m httpx robots badsecrets secretsdb -c web_spider_distance=2 web_spider_depth=2
```
Subdomains, emails, cloud buckets, port scan, basic web, web screenshots, nuclei
```
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum email-enum cloud-enum web-basic -m nmap gowitness nuclei --allow-deadly
```
You can clean up the output to just found subdomains per line like so:
```
cat /root/.bbot/scans/{scan_name}/output.txt | grep -F '[DNS_NAME]â€™ | awk '{print $2}'
```





## BGP ASN Search
Its a good idea to search ASNs of the target company to see if they are in any other IP ranges. Go to https://bgp.he.net/ and type in the name of a company name (not the .com added to it) and search. It will give you a list of ASNs and Routes for anything matching that name. Looking under ASN, you may find additonal domains under the Prefix IPV4 tab
